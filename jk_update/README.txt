screen-field notes help with screen rotation.

main contains the code I have thus far. 

also, colors and string xml files under (Monster\app\src\main\res\values) are missing cases. my acccachments are a start,

but the Monster setup will not run without them.

*****strings.xml****** is the file that needs to be finished, as I completed color.

Fill in the correct code for the strings under strings.xml and that part should work.
